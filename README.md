# Crowdfunding-ETL

## The purpose of this activity was to use ETL to extract and utilize crowdfunding backer data.  Using Python and SQL queries we were able to extract and transform the backer data in an effort to target backers who were a part of current crowdfunding campaigns.  At the end of the task, we created a list of donors by email address who could be contacted and informed about how much more the project needed to be fully funded.
